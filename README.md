# Agohya Spec

## The specification language for the upcoming (under-development) programming language, Agohya by NBRG Developers

## The below is in reference to AgohyaLang and not AgohyaSpec. This spec lang is a secondary project, which is expected to come into production use once AgohyaLang reaches stable release 1.0.0

### We are actively looking for collaborators for AgohyaLang, the open source, community-driven programming language. For contributing, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/agohya/lang/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Features (Proposed)

* All operators `(+, -, *, /, %)`
* Functions Support
* Static Typing
* `NULL Safe` Types
* Platform Independence

  * Should run on (List in order of priority of implementation.):

        1. Windows
        2. Linux
        3. MacOS
        4. Android
        5. iOS
  * Provide Optional Access to Platform Specific APIs.

### Information About The Tech Stack to use

We are keen on using the following tech-stack to keep this language as modern and fast as possible.

### Agohya Lang is going to be an AOT compiled language with support for JIT compilation in debug mode

* Antlr4 to generate Lexer/Parser.
* Own implementation for generating AST which will be used in the next step.
* LLVM to generate the IR using the AST generated by our custom implementation.
* LLVM optimization on the IR
* LLVM compilation to machine code/Assembly Code (yet to decide)
